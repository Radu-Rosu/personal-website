<p>
  I was member in my high school’s robotics club for 3 years and I activated in
  the Department of Mechanics.<br />
  My duties were to create the 3D model of each major component and to help at
  building and fixing issues.<br />
  Our team participated in the FTC contest (First Tech Challenge) up to the
  regionals.<br />
  During the first year of undergraduate studies, I participated with 3 other
  colleagues at the Students Scientific Communications Session with a project
  and we took Mention.<br />
  The project was about a 3D interactive game which presented the laws of
  Newtonian Mechanics, our goal being to make learning Physics easier for
  everybody.
