        I am currently a 2nd year bachelor student at the Faculty of Automatic
        Control and Computers from Politehnica University of Bucharest,
        Romania.<br />
        I graduated high school from the “Vasile Alecsandri” National College in
        Galati(grade 9.9/10), specialization of mathematics and computer
        science.

        I was member in my high school’s robotics club for 3 years and I
        activated in the Department of Mechanics.<br />
        My duties were to create the 3D model of each major component and to
        help at building and fixing issues.<br />
        Our team participated in the FTC contest (First Tech Challenge) up to
        the regionals.<br />
        During the first year of undergraduate studies, I participated with 3
        other colleagues at the Students Scientific Communications Session with
        a project and we took Mention.<br />
        The project was about a 3D interactive game which presented the laws of
        Newtonian Mechanics, our goal being to make learning Physics easier for
        everybody.
